        <h1>About TheGorder</h1>
        <p>TheGorder is a Private Membership Association dedicated to educating, advocating, and sponsoring Masonic education for those interested in its teachings. Founded by individuals passionate about wisdom, self-improvement, and knowledge, we provide an independent space for learning.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We are not affiliated with any official Masonic body. Our goal is to offer educational resources and guidance on Masonic philosophy, history, and symbolism. We emphasize that our students are not Freemasons unless they officially swear in through a recognized Masonic lodge.</p>
        
        <h2>Masonic Rings & Support</h2>
        <p>While TheGorder educates on Masonic teachings, we do not claim Masonic authority. We get the rings we sell from the Masons, ensuring that any proceeds from the sales directly benefit the Masonic institutions that produce them.</p>
